			"resolveSourceMapLocations": ["**", "!**/node_modules/**"] //This is key, the source maps to resolve end up located in your temp directory, and vscode by default only looks in your workspace directory. You can also set this to null or an empty array, but source maps in node_modules might get evaluated which may slow you down significantly unless you specifically want to debug those. NOTE: The latest non-released build of wrangler as of 2023-10-15 moves the temp files to the .wrangler folder in your workspace dir, so this is no longer needed as it is automatically detected correctly.
